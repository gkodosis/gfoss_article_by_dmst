# Article for the GFOSS - Open Technologies Alliance
This project is aimed for the composition of an article for the GFOSS â€“ Open Technologies Alliance ( https://gfoss.eu/ ).

The article is composed by undergraduate students of the Athens University of Economics and Business (AUEB) from the Department of 
Management Science and Technology (DMST).

The project is being developed in the context of the course 'Software Engineering in Process' under the supervision of our professor, Mr. Diomidis Spinellis. The Open Technologies Alliance has asked
us to provide an article regarding our semester assignment 'Contribution to an Open-Source Project'. 

In this article we share our experience, thoughts, opinions and recommendations regarding the aforementioned assignment. 

The article is currently written in Greek but there are chances it will be translated into English in the future.
